Description of my Work: I have made this project with Next.js and Node.js(backend)

First you will find a page where you can select your role (Admin, Author and Reader) and saving along with your name and email to verify your role. 

After introducing your role you will navigate to all blogs. If you select your role Admin you can delete and edit any post you want. If you select your role Author, you can only edit and delete your post. And if your don’t select any role it will be Reader and you won’t be able to edit or delete post. 

Every post is clickable and you will navigate to individual post page. There you can edit and delete all post if you are an admin, only your post will be edited and deleted if you are Author. But Reader can’t delete or edit anything. 

Everyone can comment on an individual blog post. 

I have implemented the search functionality with the title name. You can find this where all blog post appear. 

I fetched the data from mongoDB database bu SSR (Server Side Rendering) by getServerSideProps your can find this on my github repo. 

I have made this task mobile friendly by custom CSS.
